# Python-Simple-Speech_Recognition

Pretty trivial speech recognition and test to speech

hopefully I will write my own implementation from it

It is a common code and I implemented and was inspired by the works of others, not entirly my idea

First need to install these packages:

        pip install speechrecognition
        pip install pyttsx3
        pip install pyaudio
        pip install playsound
        pip install PyObjC

# Things that it will do:

1. what is my name?
2. what is your name?
3. what is the date?
4. search: (it will open a new tab in the default browser and searches the google)
5. location: (it will search a location on google map)
6. exit (using: exit, thank you, bye command)

hope you enjoy it
send me back feedbacks or ideas for new projects
Thank you
bye bye
